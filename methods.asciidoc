== Method

=== System Architecture
The machine learning and deep learning pipeline is designed with modularity and scalability in mind. The architecture is composed of several key modules:

. Data Fetching Module: Responsible for API interactions to fetch and update data. It includes separate scripts for different data sources to ensure modularity.
. Data Preprocessing Module: Includes a master script for initial cleaning and transformations, complemented by additional scripts tailored to specific model requirements.
. Feature Engineering Module: A standalone module that generates features based on configurations specified in the model training scripts.
. Modeling Module: Organized into separate directories for each category of modelsâ€”traditional statistical models, machine learning models, deep learning models, and state-of-the-art models. Each directory contains specific scripts for each model type.
. Evaluation Module: A centralized module to evaluate models using standardized metrics, facilitating comparison across different models.
. Visualization and Reporting Module: Used for generating output visualizations, performance reports, and potentially interactive dashboards.

=== Component Interaction
The pipeline operates with a clear data and control flow:
* Data Flow: Data moves from the fetching module through preprocessing and feature engineering, and finally into the respective modeling modules.
* Control Flow: Managed by a master script or orchestrator, which sequences operations to ensure data is processed, features are engineered, models are trained, and evaluated systematically.

=== Algorithms and Models
The pipeline incorporates a diverse set of models to address different aspects of time series forecasting:

. Traditional Statistical Models: AR, ARIMA, SARIMA, ARIMAX, SARIMAX.
. Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, SVM/SVRegressor, KNN, RandomForest, ExtraTrees.
. Deep Learning Models: LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, GRU, Bi-directional GRU, Simple RNN, Stacked RNN, Attention LSTM, CNN LSTM.
. State-of-the-Art Models: TCN, NBeats, WaveNet, LSTNet, Transformer.

Each model category is tailored to the unique challenges posed by the volatility and complexity of cryptocurrency data, with a focus on robustness, efficiency, and predictive accuracy.
