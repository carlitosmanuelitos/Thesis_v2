== Implementation

The implementation of the cryptocurrency price forecasting pipeline will be executed in phases, each corresponding to a key component of the pipeline:

. **Data Collection and Storage:**
  - Implement the API fetching system using Python scripts.
  - Set up local structured storage environments, categorizing data by cryptocurrency, granularity, and retrieval time span.
  - Ensure data is timestamped upon extraction for traceability.

. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:**
  - Develop the master preprocessing script for handling common preprocessing tasks.
  - Create separate preprocessing pipelines tailored to specific models.
  - Implement the feature engineering module that allows configurable feature creation.

. **Model Development and Evaluation:**
  - Set up directories and scripts for each category of models: traditional, machine learning, deep learning, and state-of-the-art models.
  - Implement a centralized evaluation module to apply standardized metrics across all models.

. **Visualization and Reporting:**
  - Develop interactive visualizations using Plotly for dynamic data interaction.
  - Set up a reporting module to generate and store performance reports and insights.

. **Deployment and Maintenance:**
  - Prepare the environment for model deployment, potentially including cloud platforms if local resources are insufficient.
  - Establish a system for ongoing maintenance, including periodic updates and model retraining.

Each phase will involve rigorous testing and documentation to ensure system integrity and maintainability.
