== Milestones

The implementation of the machine learning and deep learning pipeline will be tracked through the following key milestones:

. **Milestone 1: Setup and Initial Testing**
  - Completion of the data fetching and initial storage setup.
  - Initial tests to validate API interactions and data storage mechanisms.
  - Estimated completion: 1 month after project start.

. **Milestone 2: Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Complete**
  - Completion of all preprocessing scripts and the feature engineering module.
  - Full dataset processed and ready for model input.
  - Estimated completion: 2 months after project start.

. **Milestone 3: Model Development and Initial Evaluation**
  - All planned models are developed and have undergone initial testing.
  - Initial evaluation results are documented.
  - Estimated completion: 4 months after project start.

. **Milestone 4: Comprehensive Evaluation and Optimization**
  - Comprehensive testing across all models using the evaluation framework.
  - Optimization of models based on initial results.
  - Estimated completion: 6 months after project start.

. **Milestone 5: Visualization, Reporting, and Deployment**
  - Completion of the visualization and reporting modules.
  - System ready for deployment.
  - Deployment of the pipeline on the selected platform.
  - Estimated completion: 8 months after project start.

. **Milestone 6: Project Closure and Documentation**
  - Final adjustments and refinements based on feedback.
  - Comprehensive documentation completed.
  - Final project report prepared.
  - Estimated completion: 10 months after project start.

These milestones will guide the development process and help ensure that the project remains on schedule.
