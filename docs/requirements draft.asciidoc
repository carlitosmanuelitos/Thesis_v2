== Requirements

=== Must Have
* API-based data fetching system for robust and flexible handling of various cryptocurrencies.
* Basic data preprocessing framework for cleaning and handling issues like missing values and outliers.
* Core feature engineering module to implement fundamental features such as lag features and moving averages.
* Development and implementation of at least one model from each major category (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM).
* Implementation of basic evaluation metrics such as MAE and RMSE for model performance assessment.
* Basic visualization tools for plotting historical price data and forecasting results.

=== Should Have
* Advanced feature engineering capabilities, including rolling statistics and seasonal decomposition.
* Comprehensive data analytics for additional insights like volatility measurements and historical performance metrics.
* Enhanced variety of models and newer methodologies to broaden the forecasting capabilities.
* Advanced interactive visualizations using tools like Plotly for dynamic data interaction.
* Hyperparameter tuning system to refine and optimize model performance.

=== Could Have
* Integration of sentiment data from social media or news sources to enhance predictive features.
* Automated system for model retraining and updating to maintain accuracy with new data.
* Extended backtesting capabilities to validate model predictions across different market conditions.

=== Won't Have
* Direct integration with trading platforms for real-time trading based on forecasts.
* Extensive parsing and incorporation of unstructured data such as detailed news articles beyond basic sentiment analysis.

=== Technical Requirements
* Programming languages: Python, due to its robust support in data science and machine learning.
* Key libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch, and Plotly.
* Data storage: Local storage in initial phases, scalable to cloud storage as needed.
* APIs for data fetching: Preferably robust and well-documented APIs like Alpha Vantage or CoinAPI.
* Version control: Git, to manage code versions and facilitate potential collaborative efforts.
