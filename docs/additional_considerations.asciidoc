Additional Analytics Considerations
Here are a few additional analyses you might consider:

Drawdown: Calculate the maximum drawdown in the period, which can be a useful risk metric.
Simple Moving Averages: Track moving averages to see how they compare to the actual price over time.
Exponential Moving Averages: More weight to recent prices, useful for identifying trends.
Trading Volume Analysis: Assessing how volume correlates with price changes can reveal trader behavior.
Price Oscillators: Such as the stochastic oscillator to determine overbought or oversold conditions.
Risk-Adjusted Returns: Sharpe ratio or Sortino ratio to measure how much return is being achieved for the taken risk.
